# stocks-analysis
In this project I computed the total volume of the stocks and calculated the percent of the stocks volatility. This information showed the outcome of the stocks success while they were being traded in the years 2017 and 2018. This is helpful when trying to figure out which stocks would be sucessful and which you should trading. In the Excel file we have created a tool that is useful and informatived to anyone who is intrested in investing in the stocks that are computed in this data.

The performance of the stocks in 2017 and 2018 differ drasticaly in the return percentages. In 2017 the majority of the stocks were positive in the return while in 2018 there were only 2 stocks that were positive in the return.

The speed of the calculations has changed by quite a bit. This can be very helpful when running bigger set of data because we made the code more efficient.

2017(original code): 0.65625
2017(refactored): 0.109375
2018(original code): 0.7109375
2018(refactored): 0.109375

There are many reasons why the refactored code is preferable. Some of the advantes include the speed of the output and the removal of hard code which has increased the general usage to repurpose this code to do future calculations.
